# PyMP3
MP3 player built on Python using PyGame and tkinter

Before launching PyMP3 install PyGame and test availability of tkinter

At first, lets test availability of tkinter by running:

	python(3 if you are using UNIX) -m tkinter

If the output is an error follow the instructions below:

UNIX:

Open bash. Now run this command:

	sudo apt-get install python3-tk

WINDOWS:

Move tkinter folder to %PathToPython%\Lib\

Now tkinter will be running OK.

Now lets install PyGame by running:

	pip(3 if you are using UNIX) install pygame

PyGame installed, tkinter is running OK. Now lets run PyMP3

To run PyMP3 run this command:

	python(3 if you are using UNIX) pymp3.py

Enjoy listening to your music!
